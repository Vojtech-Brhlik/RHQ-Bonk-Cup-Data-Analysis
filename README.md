# RHQ-Bonk-Cup-Data-Analysis
RHQ Bonk Cup is a for-fun event in the game Trackmania. The event is played on user-made maps that other players drive on. At the time of writing this readme, there were 190 editions of Bonk Cup. 

The organiser of the event provided me with some simple data of the maps and mappers that have been uploaded to the dedicated server so far.
I used this data to give them some interesting statistics and numbers for the maps and mappers.
